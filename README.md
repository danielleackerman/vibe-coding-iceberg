# 🧊 Vibe Coding Iceberg

> A personal learning vault and public resource for demystifying modern AI-assisted software development — from UI prototyping to infrastructure deployment.

---

## 🌟 What Is This?

This repo is a **living map** of the "Vibe Coding Iceberg" — a layered mental model for understanding how modern app development works when powered by AI tools like Replit, Bolt, Cursor, Subframe, and Supabase.

It starts with a single markdown file of raw notes, questions, insights, and definitions. Over time, it may evolve into a fully published GitHub Pages site.

## 💡 Why "Vibe Coding"?

"Vibe coding" is the emerging practice of using tools and prompts to generate real software — not just from vague ideas, but from **clear specifications as prompts**.

This repo exists to:

- Track those tools
- Understand how they work under the hood
- Collect prompt examples that reveal the hidden layers
- Explore the full stack of modern development as an iceberg

---

## 🧱 Iceberg Layers

Each layer of the iceberg represents a part of the stack:

1. **UI & Interaction** – React, Tailwind, Subframe
2. **App Logic** – Form handling, routing, validation
3. **Services & APIs** – Firebase, Supabase, Stripe, OpenAI
4. **Data Modeling** – Prisma, Drizzle, SQL
5. **Infrastructure & CI/CD** – Vercel, Netlify, Astro, serverless
6. **AI Prompting** – How language connects all the layers

## 🗂 What's in Here?

- `iceberg-notes.md` — your working vault of insights, prompts, and tools
- (Coming soon) Structured `.md` files by layer
- (Optional) A MkDocs or Astro site for publishing

---

## 🧪 Still in Draft Mode

This is a WIP (work in progress) intended for:

- Code-curious designers
- Prompt engineers and tool tinkerers
- Indie developers exploring AI-first workflows
