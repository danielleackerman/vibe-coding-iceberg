# 🧊 Coding For Vibes

> A vibey personal learning vault and public resource for mapping modern AI-assisted software development — from UI prototyping to infrastructure deployment.


## 💡 What Is This?

This repo is a **living map** of the "Vibe Coding Iceberg" — a layered mental model for understanding how modern app development works when powered by AI tools like Replit, Bolt, Cursor, Subframe, and Supabase and more.



## ⛰️ What Iceberg?

## 🧊 Iceberg Layers

Each layer of the iceberg represents a part of the tech stack:

1. **UI & Interaction** – React, Tailwind, Subframe
2. **App Logic** – Form handling, routing, validation
3. **Services & APIs** – Firebase, Supabase, Stripe, OpenAI
4. **Data Modeling** – Prisma, Drizzle, SQL
5. **Infrastructure & CI/CD** – Vercel, Netlify, Astro, serverless
6. **AI Prompting** – How language connects all the layers



## 💡 Why Am I Sweating?

"Vibe coding" is the emerging practice of using tools and prompts to generate real software — not just from vague ideas, but from **clear specifications as prompts**.

This repo exists to:

- Track those tools
- Understand how they work under the hood
- Collect prompt examples that reveal the hidden layers
- Explore the full stack of modern development as an iceberg


## 🗂 What's in Here?

- `iceberg-notes.md` — your working vault of insights, prompts, and tools
- (Coming soon) Structured `.md` files by layer
- (Optional) A MkDocs or Astro site for publishing



## 🧪 Chipping Away

This is a WIP (work in progress) still in draft mode. It's intended for:

- Code-curious designers
- Prompt engineers and tool tinkerers
- Indie developers exploring AI-first workflows
- Gluttons for punishment in an existential crisis
